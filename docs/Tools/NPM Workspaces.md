# Why NPM Workspaces
When embarking on a JavaScript project, it's common to begin with boilerplate templates that set up an NPM project structure along with some initial code. 
Tools like `npx create-next-app` or `npx create-remix` streamline this process by swiftly creating the foundation for your project.

During the development phase, the frequent use of `npm install` becomes routine as you add and manage project dependencies.

However, as your projects grow and evolve, you might find yourself dealing with multiple related projects within the same GIT repository, a setup often referred to as a "Monorepo." 
These projects are distinct entities but share the same repository for streamlined version control and collaboration.

The challenge arises when one project within the Monorepo depends on code or functionality from another project within the same repository. 
This interdependence can lead to complications in terms of managing shared code, coordinating updates, and ensuring consistency.

This is where NPM Workspaces come to the rescue. NPM Workspaces is a feature designed to simplify the management of such interdependent projects within a Monorepo. 
It offers a coherent solution by allowing you to group and manage related projects together, thus enhancing development efficiency and maintainability.

With NPM Workspaces, you can:

1. **Share Dependencies**: Workspaces enable you to share common dependencies at the root level of the Monorepo, reducing redundant installations and potential conflicts.
2. **Unified Development**: Developers can work on multiple projects simultaneously and observe changes in real-time without the need for manual linking or separate installations.
3. **Streamlined Scripting**: Automation becomes easier with the ability to execute scripts across all projects within the workspace.
4. **Collaboration**: Teams can work cohesively on different projects while following consistent development practices.
5. **Versioning Coherence**: NPM Workspaces encourages a uniform versioning strategy across all projects, minimizing version conflicts.

# Create workspaces
To initiate NPM Workspaces, create a package.json file at the root of your Monorepo and specify a "workspaces" array containing paths to your workspace projects. NPM will then manage the dependencies and interactions between the projects within the workspace.

For instance, consider the following simplified package.json snippet:

{% code title="package.json" %}
```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "projects/*"
  ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

In this example, all subdirectories within the "projects" directory are treated as workspace projects.

NPM Workspaces streamline the development workflow for managing multiple interdependent projects within a Monorepo. 
While they enhance local development and testing, it's important to note that individual projects may still need to be published to NPM if they are intended for external consumption.

Please bear in mind that including `private: true` in your configuration is a mandatory step. Workspaces are designed for internal use and are not intended for publication. This precautionary measure has been implemented to prevent any inadvertent exposure of your workspaces, ensuring that they remain secure and inaccessible to external publishing.

# CLI support
In terms of command-line interface (CLI) usage, NPM Workspaces maintain a familiar experience. By default, commands are applied universally across all projects within the workspace. However, if you want to target a specific workspace and exclude others, you can achieve this using the `--workspace` or `-w` option.

This approach offers a convenient and flexible way to manage various projects within the Monorepo. Here's how it works:

1. **Default Behavior**: Without specifying the --workspace option, commands executed at the root level of the Monorepo will automatically apply to all projects within the workspace. This is advantageous when you want changes to propagate across all projects simultaneously.
2. **Selective Targeting**: To narrow down the scope of a command to a specific workspace project, you can utilize the --workspace or -w option followed by the name of the target workspace. This feature is particularly useful when you want to isolate changes, installations, or other actions to a single project.

# Create projects
Consider the following directory structure as our current setup:

```
workspace
├── package.json
└── projects
```

The `package.json` in our workspace has already been configured as shown above. Now, let's proceed to create two new projects using the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app 
npx create-next-app 
```
It's important to note that commands can be executed from any location within the workspace—whether directly under the root directory or within any project folder. When executing a command within a specific project, it doesn't imply that the command's effects are limited to that project alone. By default, commands affect all projects in the workspace, regardless of the project from which the command is executed.

# Other tools
When it comes to using workspaces in a Monorepo setup, both NPM and Yarn provide similar capabilities for managing interdependent projects.
While the dissimilarities might not be immediately obvious, they primarily pertain to command options, much like the distinctions found in other commands between NPM and Yarn.

Apart from NPM and Yarn, there are other tools that also support the concept of workspaces or similar Monorepo management approaches. Some of these tools include:

Lerna: Lerna is a popular tool specifically designed for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It provides commands to bootstrap, publish, and manage packages within a Monorepo. Lerna works well with both NPM and Yarn.

Rush: Rush is developed by the Microsoft engineering teams and is optimized for large-scale Monorepo management. It offers advanced features for parallelizing builds and managing dependencies.

Bazel: Bazel is a build tool that emphasizes reproducibility and performance. While not specifically focused on JavaScript, it can be used to manage a Monorepo across multiple programming languages.

Nx: Nx is a toolkit for full-stack development using Angular, React, and Node.js. It provides tools for Monorepo management, code generation, and build optimization.

Pnpm: Pnpm is an alternative package manager to NPM and Yarn. It supports a Monorepo setup and offers features like hoisting dependencies, caching, and workspace support.

Bolt: Bolt is a tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages. It focuses on optimizing tasks like linking, building, and publishing packages.

Rush Stack: Rush Stack is an extension of Rush that focuses on TypeScript and JavaScript projects. It provides tools for managing build and deployment workflows.

Each of these tools has its own features, advantages, and approaches to managing Monorepos and workspaces. The choice of tool depends on factors such as the size of your projects, your preferred development workflow, and the specific requirements of your team. It's recommended to explore the documentation and features of each tool to determine which one aligns best with your project's needs.
