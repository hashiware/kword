When embarking on a JavaScript project, it's common to begin with boilerplate templates that set up an NPM project structure along with some initial code. 
Tools like `npx create-next-app` or `npx create-next-app@latest` streamline this process by swiftly creating the foundation for your project.

During the development phase, the frequent use of `npm install` becomes routine as you add and manage project dependencies.

However, as your projects grow and evolve, you might find yourself dealing with multiple related projects within the same GIT repository, a setup often referred to as a "Monorepo." 
These projects are distinct entities but share the same repository for streamlined version control and collaboration.

The challenge arises when one project within the Monorepo depends on code or functionality from another project within the same repository. 
This interdependence can lead to complications in terms of managing shared code, coordinating updates, and ensuring consistency.

This is where NPM Workspaces come to the rescue. NPM Workspaces is a feature designed to simplify the management of such interdependent projects within a Monorepo. 
It offers a coherent solution by allowing you to group and manage related projects together, thus enhancing development efficiency and maintainability.

With NPM Workspaces, you can:

1. **Share Dependencies**: Workspaces enable you to share common dependencies at the root level of the Monorepo, reducing redundant installations and potential conflicts.
2. **Unified Development**: Developers can work on multiple projects simultaneously and observe changes in real-time without the need for manual linking or separate installations.
3. **Streamlined Scripting**: Automation becomes easier with the ability to execute scripts across all projects within the workspace.
4. **Collaboration**: Teams can work cohesively on different projects while following consistent development practices.
5. **Versioning Coherence**: NPM Workspaces encourages a uniform versioning strategy across all projects, minimizing version conflicts.

To initiate NPM Workspaces, create a package.json file at the root of your Monorepo and specify a "workspaces" array containing paths to your workspace projects. NPM will then manage the dependencies and interactions between the projects within the workspace.

For instance, consider the following simplified package.json snippet:

{% code title="package.json" %}
```json
{
  "name": "my-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "projects/*"
  ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

In this example, all subdirectories within the "projects" directory are treated as workspace projects.

NPM Workspaces streamline the development workflow for managing multiple interdependent projects within a Monorepo. 
While they enhance local development and testing, it's important to note that individual projects may still need to be published to NPM if they are intended for external consumption.

In terms of command-line interface (CLI) usage, NPM Workspaces maintain a familiar experience. By default, commands are applied universally across all projects within the workspace. However, if you want to target a specific workspace and exclude others, you can achieve this using the `--workspace` or `-w` option.

This approach offers a convenient and flexible way to manage various projects within the Monorepo. Here's how it works:

1. **Default Behavior**: Without specifying the --workspace option, commands executed at the root level of the Monorepo will automatically apply to all projects within the workspace. This is advantageous when you want changes to propagate across all projects simultaneously.
2. **Selective Targeting**: To narrow down the scope of a command to a specific workspace project, you can utilize the --workspace or -w option followed by the name of the target workspace. This feature is particularly useful when you want to isolate changes, installations, or other actions to a single project.
